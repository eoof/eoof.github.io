Malcolm Gladwell [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule) about 10,000 hour rule to achieve "greatness" in any given field requiring skills and expertise. Many dispute this and [Anders Ericsson](http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf) by citing quality vs. quantity of efforts and time. Tim Ferris and others claim that one can have world-class skills in 6 months or less by using creative feedback loop, deliberate practice, and other smarter ways of learning.

Peter Norvig [wrote](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) against some books with titles like "Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours".  Books like [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) takes time to read and comprehend. Each year I revisit the book and learn something new. That is only a tiny part of overall learning process and required readings.

Yes, it is possible to learn React and enough javascript to be hired as a fullstack engineer creating PWA or SPA webapps in months. Hopefully that will start the journey to learn deeply about the topic of computer science. And not just as a way to make a living.  One needs purpose in the chosen work in life. Beyond quick returns.

I found most Hacker School graduates have not read [The Humble Programmer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html).  Granted it was written probably before most of Coding School folks were born. I think it is useful to read about this discipline as presented by Professor Dijkstra at ACM Turing lecture, 1972.

For several decades, I have enjoyed programming in various languages and systems in pursuit of different goals. Some had practical scientific goals. Some just for fun. But I find that each day I have new things to learn. Almost too many. Each day I realize I need to continue learning to keep up. This endeavor we call programming is a lifelong process of learning.  It's about a way of life. And that means it isn't about 10,000 hours, 24 hours, or 10 years.  Life is more meaningful.
