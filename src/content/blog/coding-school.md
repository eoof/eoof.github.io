Malcolm Gladwell [wrote](https://www.newyorker.com/sports/sporting-scene/complexity-and-the-ten-thousand-hour-rule) about 10,000 hour rule to achieve "greatness" in any given field requiring skills and expertise. Many dispute this and [Anders Ericsson](http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf) by citing quality vs. quantity of efforts and time. Tim Ferris and others claim that one can have world-class skills in 6 months or less by using creative feedback loop, deliberate practice, and other smarter ways of learning.

Peter Norvig [wrote](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) against some books with titles like "Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours".  Books like [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs) takes time to read and comprehend. Each year I revisit the book and learn something new. That is only a tiny part of overall learning process and required readings.

Yes, it is possible to learn React and enough javascript to be hired as a fullstack engineer creating PWA or SPA webapps in months. Hopefully that will start the journey to learn deeply about the topic of computer science. And not just as a way to make a living.  One needs purpose in the chosen work in life. Beyond quick returns.

For several decades, I have programmed in various languages and systems in pursuit of different goals. I find that each day I have new things to learn. Each day I realize I need to continue learning. This endeavor we call programming is a lifelong process of learning. It should not be considered anything less.  The goal should not be about acquiring expertise, or money.  It's about a way of life.
