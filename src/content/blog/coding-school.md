Malcolm Gladwell wrote about 10,000 hour rule to achieve "greatness" in any given field requiring skills and expertise. Many dispute this and [Anders Ericsson](http://projects.ict.usc.edu/itw/gel/EricssonDeliberatePracticePR93.pdf) by citing quality vs. quantity of efforts and time. Tim Ferris and others claim that one can have world-class skills in 6 months or less by using creative feedback loop, deliberate practice, and other smarter ways of learning.

I have been coding pretty much every day for the past 35 years. I belong to the last batch of students in early 1980s universities where computing was largely done on teletype, dumb terminals or even keypunch machines. Nowadays I still use `emacs` and `vi` but I prefer modern tools like the `vscode` I am typing this in. This blog software (Hugo) is implemented in `golang`, javascript and uses `disqus`, google analytics and `mailchimp`. It is hosted on github.

I have shipped systems that run on robots deep in the oceans, on another planet, in every continent. I've coded in dozens of languages and systems over the years. Yet, I still find that each day I have new things to learn. This endeavor we call programming is a lifelong process of learning. It should not be considered anything less.  The goal should not be about acquiring expertise, or money.  It's about a way of life.
